🎴 KADI GAME LOGIC & ENVIRONMENT BLUEPRINT

💠 A♠ (Ace of Spades) 

When to Play:

Can be played at any time, regardless of the top card.

May also be played during a penalty chain (2s, 3s, Jokers) — it cancels all penalties and activates its request ability.

Action:

The Ace of Spades has no play restrictions.

When played, the player declares a specific card (rank and suit) that the next player must play.

The requested card must be played immediately if available.

If the next player does not have the requested card, they must pick 1 card and end their turn.

If the requested card is played, play continues from that card.

If the next player instead plays any other Ace, the request is canceled, and play shifts to that Ace’s suit.

The next player after that must play a card that matches the new suit.

Effect:

Cancels all active penalties (2, 3, or Joker).

Overrides all turn restrictions — playable at any time.

Requests a specific card from the next player.

Request can be canceled if the next player plays any other Ace, changing the required suit to that Ace’s suit.

✅ Examples

Example 1 – Standard Request:

Top card: 9♣

Player A plays A♠ → requests “Q♥.”

Player B has Q♥, plays it → request fulfilled, play continues from Q♥.

If Player B doesn’t have Q♥, they pick 1 card, and turn passes.

Example 2 – Request During Penalty Chain:

Current chain: 2♦ → pending pick = 2.

Player A plays A♠, cancels penalty, and requests “10♣.”

Player B must play 10♣, or if not available, pick 1.

Example 3 – Request Canceled by Another Ace:

Player A plays A♠, requests “7♦.”

Player B plays A♥ → request canceled.

The required suit now becomes Hearts (♥).

Next player (Player C) must play a card that matches the suit (♥).

Summary Rule:

A♠ can be played at any time, even during penalties.

It cancels all penalties and allows the player to request a specific card.

The request can be overridden if the next player plays any other Ace, shifting play to that Ace’s suit.

The next player must then follow the new suit.

Cannot be played in combo.

========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

💠 A♦, A♥, A♣ 

Action:
These Aces serve two functions depending on context:

🅰️ Option 1: Cancel Penalty

If a penalty chain is active (2, 3, or Joker), playing one of these Aces cancels all penalties.

All pending picks are cleared.

The previous card before the penalty becomes the new top card, and normal play resumes.

Example:

Top card: 2♣ → pending pick = 2.

Player B plays A♦ → all penalties canceled.

Top card remains 2♣, and play continues by suit or rank.

🅰️ Option 2: Change Suit

When no penalty exists, an Ace may be played to change the required suit.

The suit of the Ace determines what the next player must play.

Example:

Top card: 10♣ (no penalty)

Player A plays A♥ → required suit becomes Hearts (♥).

Next player must play a Heart (♥) or another Ace.

Effect:

Cancels penalties (2, 3, Joker).

Changes the required suit for the next player.

Cannot be combined with other cards.

May also cancel a request from A♠ if played immediately after it.

✅ Example – Canceling A♠ Request

Player A plays A♠, requests “Q♦.”

Player B plays A♦ → request canceled.
The next player must now play a card that matches suit ♦ (Diamonds) or rank A.

Summary Rule:

A♠ (Ace of Spades) – The Commander.

Cancels all penalties.

Allows player to request any specific card.

Can be canceled only by another Ace.

A♦, A♥, A♣ 

Cancel penalties or change suit depending on context.

Also cancel requests made by A♠.

All Aces must be played individually — never in a combo.

========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

🂢 / 🂣 / 🃏 Penalty Cards – Twos, Threes, and Jokers

(2♦, 2♥, 2♣, 2♠)
(3♦, 3♥, 3♣, 3♠)
🃏 Red Joker / Black Joker

When to Play:

Play a 2, 3, or Joker when the top card matches it by suit, rank, or color (for Jokers).

Action:

Each card adds to the penalty draw total unless canceled by an Ace.

🂢 2 → +2 cards

🂣 3 → +3 cards

🃏 Joker → +5 cards

Penalty cards can be stacked in any order as long as they match by suit, rank, or color (for Jokers).
If a player cannot continue the chain, they must pick the total penalty cards, and play resumes with the last penalty card as the top card.

✅ Example Scenarios
🃏 Scenario 1 – Starting with a Joker (Color Match Chain)

Top card: 8♥
Player A plays Red Joker → next player must pick 5.
Player B plays 3♥ → total becomes Pick 8 (Joker matches red suit ♥).
Player C plays 2♦ → total becomes Pick 10.
Player D plays A♣ → all penalties canceled.

💡 Jokers connect to red cards (♥♦) if Red Joker, or black cards (♣♠) if Black Joker.

🂣 Scenario 2 – Stacking Same-Rank Penalty Cards

Top card: K♠
Player A plays 3♠ → next player must pick 3.
Player B plays 3♥ + 3♣ + 3♦ → total penalty becomes Pick 12 (3+3+3+3).
Player C plays A♥ → cancels all penalties.

💡 Multiple 3s can be played together as a combo because they share the same rank.

🂢 Scenario 3 – Classic 2 and 3 Chain

Top card: 10♦
Player A plays 2♦ → next player must pick 2.
Player B plays 3♦ → total becomes Pick 5.
Player C plays 2♠ → total becomes Pick 7.
Player D chooses to pick 7 cards → the last card (2♠) stays on top.
Next player must now play a card that matches suit ♠ or rank 2.

🂢 Scenario 4 – 2s and Jokers Mixed

Top card: Q♣
Player A plays 2♣ → next player must pick 2.
Player B plays Black Joker → total becomes Pick 7 (2+5).
Player C plays 3♠ → total becomes Pick 10.
Player D plays A♦ → cancels all penalties.

🃏 Scenario 5 – Double Joker Chain (Same Color Rule)

Top card: 6♠
Player A plays Black Joker → next player must pick 5.
Player B plays another Black Joker → total becomes Pick 10.
Player C has no matching card → picks 10 cards, and Black Joker stays on top.
Next player must play a black card (♠ or ♣) or another Black Joker.

🂢 Scenario 6 – Mixed Colors with Cancel at End

Top card: 7♦
Player A plays 2♦ → +2.
Player B plays 3♦ → +5.
Player C plays Red Joker → +10 total.
Player D plays A♠ → all penalties canceled (Ace ends the chain).

Summary Rule:

2s, 3s, and Jokers are penalty cards that increase the draw count.

You can stack them if they match by suit, rank, or color.

Jokers match by color and are treated as equal rank to one another.

Only a single Ace can cancel the penalty chain.

If a player chooses to pick, the last penalty card remains on top, and play resumes normally by matching suit, rank, or color.

========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

🂤 Ordinary Cards

(4♦, 4♥, 4♣, 4♠)

Effect:
You can play an ordinary card by matching either the suit or the rank of the top card.

(Matches by suit ♠)

Top card: K♠

Note:
The goal is always to match the top card by suit or rank.
You may play multiple ordinary cards of the same rank in a combo, provided the first card in that combo matches the top card by suit or rank. 

========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================


🂨 Question Cards

(8♦, 8♥, 8♣, 8♠)
(Q♦, Q♥, Q♣, Q♠)

Action:
Play a Question card when the top card on the pile matches it by suit or rank.
You must follow it with an answer — an ordinary card.

You may also combine multiple Question cards of the same rank (e.g., 8♦ + 8♠ + 8♥).

The first Question card must match the top card by suit or rank.

The first answer must match the suit of the last Question card played.

Any additional answers must all share the same rank as the first answer.

If you play a Question card but choose not to answer, you must draw a card and your turn ends.

✅ Valid Examples

Top card: 5♦
You play [8♦ + answer 5♦] ✅
(8♦ matches top suit ♦; answer 5♦ follows suit of 8♦.)

Top card: 8♦
You play [8♥ + 8♠ + 8♣ + answers 5♣ + 5♥ + 5♠] ✅
(8♥ matches top rank; you combined multiple 8s of different suits; first answer 5♣ matches last question suit ♣; all answers are rank 5.)

Top card: 10♠
You play [Q♠ + answer 4♠] ✅
(Q♠ matches top suit ♠; answer 4♠ follows suit of Q♠.)

Top card: Q♦
You play [Q♣ + Q♥ + Q♠ + answers 4♠ + 4♦ + 4♥] ✅
(Q♣ matches top rank; first answer 4♠ matches last question suit ♠; all answers rank 4.)

Penalty Rule:
If you play a Question card or combination of Question cards but do not provide an answer, you must draw a card and your turn ends.

========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================


🂫 J – The Jump
When to Play:

Play J when it matches the top card by suit or rank, or when another J is on top (continuing a Jump chain).

Action:

J skips the next player’s turn.

Multiple J’s played in one move (a combo) increase the number of skipped players — e.g., 2 J’s = skip 2 players.

After a player finishes their turn by playing a J (single or combo), the system enters a 10-second global cancel phase.

⏱️ This phase is not part of any player’s turn.

During this period, any player (not just the next in sequence) may cancel the Jump by playing any J.

Only one J is needed to cancel the Jump.

If no J is played within 10 seconds, the skip effect applies automatically.

⚠️ The player who initiated the Jump cannot cancel their own Jump. 
Effect:

Each J = 1 skip.

Cancelable during a separate 10-second global timer, which starts after the Jumping player’s turn.

If canceled: skip effect is nullified, and play continues from the canceling J.

If no cancel: skip(s) are enforced automatically after the timer expires.

✅ Examples

Example 1 – Single Jump (No Cancel):

Top card: 10♣

Player A plays J♣ → declares skip next player.

Turn ends.

⏱️ 10-second cancel timer begins (global).

No one plays a J → skip applies → next player’s turn is skipped.

Example 2 – Combo Jump:

Top card: 7♥

Player A plays J♥ + J♦ → skip next 2 players.

Turn ends.

⏱️ 10-second global cancel phase begins.

Player D plays J♠ → cancels the Jump.

Play continues normally from J♠ (no skip applied).

Example 3 – Canceled Jump (Mid-Round):

Top card: Q♠

Player A plays J♠.

Turn ends.

⏱️ 10-second cancel window opens.

Player C plays J♦ during cancel phase → skip canceled.

Play continues from J♦.

Summary Rule:

J skips one player per card.

Multiple J’s = multiple skips.

After a player finishes playing a J (or combo), a 10-second global cancel timer begins.

The timer is not part of anyone’s turn.

Any player may play a J during this phase to cancel the skip.

If no J is played → skip applies automatically.

Self-canceling is not allowed.



🏆 Winning Condition — “Niko Kadi”

Eligible Cards: 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10.

Rules:

When a player’s remaining hand consists only of winning cards (single or combo), system detects and prompts “Niko Kadi?”

The player has 5 seconds to click.

If clicked → declaration shown under their profile.

If ignored or timed out → forfeited for the round.

To Win:
Final card(s) must:

Match top card’s suit or rank

Or satisfy an Ace request

Cannot be Joker

Example (Single):
Top: 6♦
You play 9♦ → remain with 10♦
System: “Niko Kadi?” → click → next turn → 10♦ played → win.

Example (Combo):
Top: 9♣
You play 9♣ + 9♥ (combo) → valid → win.


========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================


🂮 K – The Kickback
When to Play:

Play K when it matches the top card by suit or rank, or when another K is already on top (continuing a Kickback chain).

Action:

K reverses the direction of play (clockwise ↔ counterclockwise).

If multiple K’s are played in one move (combo), the direction flips back and forth for each K.

Example: 1 K = 1 reversal, 2 K’s = returns to original direction, 3 K’s = reverse again, etc.

After the player’s turn ends (after playing K or a K combo), the system activates a 10-second global cancel phase.

⏱️ This cancel phase is independent of any player’s turn.

During this phase, any player may play a K to cancel the reversal.

Only one K is required to cancel.

If no K is played within 10 seconds, the reversal applies automatically.

⚠️ The player who initiated the Kickback cannot cancel their own reversal.

Effect:

Each K = one reversal of direction.

Cancelable during the separate 10-second global phase after the player’s turn.

If canceled, play direction remains unchanged (or reverts to prior state).

If no cancel, the reversal applies automatically when the timer expires.

✅ Examples

Example 1 – Single Kickback (No Cancel):

Top card: 9♦

Player A plays K♦ → declares direction reversal.

Turn ends.

⏱️ 10-second global cancel timer starts.

No K played during this time → reversal applies automatically.

Example 2 – Combo Kickback:

Top card: 6♠

Player A plays K♠ + K♥ → 2 reversals (return to original direction).

Turn ends.

⏱️ 10-second cancel window begins.

Player D plays K♦ within 10 seconds → cancel successful.

Final direction remains unchanged.

Example 3 – Canceled Kickback:

Top card: J♣

Player A plays K♣ → reverse direction.

Turn ends.

⏱️ 10-second global cancel phase starts.

Player C plays K♠ → cancels reversal.

Play direction remains the same as before.

Summary Rule:

K reverses the direction of play.

Multiple K’s toggle direction multiple times.

After the player finishes their turn, a 10-second global cancel timer begins.

The timer is not part of any player’s turn.

Any player may play a K during this phase to cancel the reversal.

If no K appears, the reversal effect applies automatically.

Player cannot self-cancel their own Kickback.

========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
🏆 Winning the Game
Announcement – “Niko Kadi”

A player must announce “Niko Kadi” if they believe they can win on their next turn.

The announcement signals that the player intends to finish all their cards in their next move.

Winning is only valid after making this announcement.

The declaration itself does not change play order or rules — it simply grants eligibility to win.

Winning Condition:

A player wins the game when they:

Have previously announced “Niko Kadi.”

Play a legal and valid combination of cards in one move, following the standard play rules.

End up with zero cards in hand after that move.

Winning plays may consist of:

Ordinary cards (4–10) played by matching suit or rank. e.g when top card is 4♠ then I play 6♠ that is valid combo is also allowed

Question cards (8s or Qs) played together with their valid Answer cards (same suit).when top card is 4♠ then I play 8♠ + 6♠ that is valid combo is also allowed

💡 A “valid move” means the play follows the same rules as during normal play — correct matching of suit or rank, and valid Question + Answer combinations.

If the Player Announced “Niko Kadi” but Didn’t Win:

Nothing happens.

Play continues normally with the next player.

If the Player Did Not Announce “Niko Kadi” but Finishes Their Cards with Winning Rules Legally:

The win does not count, even if the final move follows valid play rules.

The player’s hand remains empty, but they are not declared the winner.

Play continues normally.

✅ Examples

Example 1 – Valid Announced Win:

Player A announces “Niko Kadi.”

On their next turn, plays 8♦ + 5♦, emptying their hand legally.

✅ Valid win — Player A wins the round.

Example 2 – Unannounced Win Attempt:

Player B does not announce “Niko Kadi.”

Plays Q♠ + 5♠, finishing their hand.

❌ Win does not count — Player b remains in play, and the game continues.

Summary Rule:

You must announce “Niko Kadi” before attempting to win.

Only valid Ordinary or Question + Answer plays can lead to victory.

If you don’t announce, your win does not count.

If you announce but fail, nothing happens — continue playing.

A win is valid only if announced beforehand and played legally.
