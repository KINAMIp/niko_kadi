  2. **Center Battlefield:** Large circular table, evenly spaced seats (2–7 players), center pile with animated shine, sliding & flipping cards.
  3. **Lower Hand Area:** Parallax fan of player cards, emerald “Pick” button when drawing is required.
- **Interactions:**
  - Real-time shuffle animation at round start.
  - Card plays feature glow trails, flips, and upward fades.
  - Cancel/Niko pop-outs burst into view, respecting personal visibility.
  - Seat halos highlight the current player.
- **Optional Voice:**

## Player Seating
- Circular arrangement around the center pile with adjustable seat size.
- Seat elements show name, profile image, card count, and active-player glow.
- Display Niko Kadi badge beneath the avatar upon declaration.

## Animation System
- Built with Rive/Flare, Lottie, or Flutter implicit animations.
- Standard behaviours:
  - Entry: scale + fade.
  - Exit: slide-down + blur.
  - Card shuffle: continuous 3D transform loop (~60 fps).
  - Screen transitions: fade → zoom → fade chain.

## Audio System
- Stereo mix with light reverb for immersion.
- **Events:**

| Event          | Sound Type | Description                     |
| -------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| Card shuffle   | Loop FX    | Crisp stereo shuffle, low mix.  |
| Card placed    | Short FX   | Flip + soft thud.               |
| Pick card      | FX         | Rising swoosh.                  |

## Cross-Screen Continuity
- Shared background motion (card swirl + gradient) between splash, lobby, and board.
- Music cross-fades between screens without restarting.
- Subtle Tucheze Kadi watermark persists in a corner on all screens.

## Performance & Responsiveness
- Use GPU-accelerated effects (Impeller/Skia).
- Dynamically lower animation detail on low-end hardware.
- Limit frame rate when idle to save battery.
- Preload audio assets for zero-latency playback.

## Future Enhancements
- 3D avatars or emoji reactions tied to gameplay events.
- Fireworks burst on win.
- Camera orbit on Kickback reversals.
- Cloud sync for voice and match replays.
